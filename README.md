## Signal peptide project

***Objectives***
- Perform a comparison between different approaches for predicting the presence of secretory signal peptides in peptides
- This recognition is a key step for functional annotation because it tells us where the protein is located in the cell. 

### Steps

1. Data collection
- Result: training_set.tsv and benchmark_set.tsv
2. Data descriptive analysis
3. vH PSWM training with k-fold cross validation.
4. vh PSWM benchmark evaluation. 
5. SVM training with grid search and cross validation
6. SVM benchmark evaluation
7. vH PSWM benchmark false positive analysis
8. SVM benchmark false positive analysis
9. vH PSWM and SVM false negative analysis
- Note: Step 9 has no corresponding python scripts. Only a jupyter notebook is available. (See jupyter_notebooks.tar.gz)
