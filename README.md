## Signal peptide project

***Objectives***
- Perform a comparison between different approaches for predicting the presence of secretory signal peptides in peptides
- This recognition is a key step for functional annotation because it tells us where the protein is located in the cell. 

### Steps

1. Data collection
- Result: training_set.tsv and benchmark_set.tsv
2. Data descriptive analysis
