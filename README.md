# Signal peptide project (Laboratory of Bioinformatics 2)

## **Objectives**
- Perform a comparison between different approaches for predicting the presence of secretory signal peptides (SP) in protein sequences
- Develop the Von Heijne Position-Specific Weight Matrix method and the non-linear SVM method using python code. 

## Steps

1. Data collection
   - **Result**: training_set.tsv and benchmark_set.tsv
2. Data descriptive analysis
3. vH PSWM training with k-fold cross validation.
4. vh PSWM benchmark evaluation. 
5. SVM training with grid search and cross validation
6. SVM benchmark evaluation
7. vH PSWM benchmark false positive analysis
8. SVM benchmark false positive analysis
9. vH PSWM and SVM false negative analysis


### Jupyter notebooks
Steps 2 and 9 have no corresponding python scripts. Only [jupyter notebooks](/jupyter_notebooks.tar.gz) are available. 
   
   
## Data availability
